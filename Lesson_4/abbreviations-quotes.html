        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.keepinspiring.me/martin-luther-king-jr-quotes/">
            <p>Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals.</p>
